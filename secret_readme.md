# Secret Reason Test

If you got to this place then you know what this is for! Please don't publicize it. We're still polishing it before the official announcement. In the meantime, come join us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml)!

## Installation

Prerequisite: having [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) installed (version 1.7+), e.g. `brew install ninja` if you're on macOS.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reasonml/rehydrate.git
cd rehydrate
npm install
npm start
```

Then open `finalOutput/*.html` (might need to start a server if you're on Chrome).

## Usage
See the `examples/` folder.
